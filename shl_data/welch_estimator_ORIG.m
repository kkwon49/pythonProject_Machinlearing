%% Function for spectra estimation by Welch's method
% Developed by Luiz A. Baccala, Fl?vio Caduda and Luciano Caldas, all from
% Escola Polit?cnica - Poli-USP, with cooperation of Carlos Pagani and Felipe
% Amaral from Escola de Engenharia de S?o Carlos - EESC-USP.
%
% Cross-spectra matrix are estimated by Welch's method with 50% overlap and
% the window energy loss are compasated by a factor of 1/sum(Wi.^2) where
% Wi are the elements of the window [1]. Then, the spectra becomes:
% Sxy = fft(x)*conj(fft(y))/sum(Wi.^2)
%
% Code was tested with a known- spectra signal from a white noise filtered
% by a filter. The variance (power) of the signal checks with the integral
% of the PSD estimated.
%
% INPUT:
% -- signals: matrix of signals to perform the spectra estimatino. Size is
% [Samples x number of sensors];
% -- fs: samplerate in Hertz;
% -- window: data taper desired. Must be a vector. For best performance it
% should be a power of 2. For general applications do: window=hanning(1024);
%
% OUTPUT:
% -- CSM: Cross Spectral Matrix: Unilateral (0:fs/2) spectra. Welch's
% method is used with 50% overlap. Matrix size: sensors x sensors x
% windowsize/2
% -- frequencies: vector with all frequencies corresponding to each layer
% (3rd layer in depth) of CSM.

% LAST REVISION: Aug - 18 - 2016
% ADDED 'fs' missing term in line 82, for calibration factor
